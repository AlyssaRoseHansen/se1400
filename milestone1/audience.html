        <h2>Projected site demographics:</h2>
                <h4>Gelocation:</h4>
                    <p>I would like locals to be some of the most frequent visitors. Idealy it would also be a tourist spot. But for the sake of building this website, locals within a 25 mile radius.</p>
                <h4>Age:</h4>
                    <p>My gardens are going to have a lot of attractions for all ages. Inspiring families, individuals, and the elderly to come back. But I will focus in on 35 to 45 year olds. This is the peak ages for parents who have slightly older children and money to come to the gardens and buy memberships.</p>
                <h4>Gender:</h4>
                    <p>I am going to focus on the female user. Going with the same mentality of the age group, most woman are a stay at home parent. Woman are also more inclined to be interested in flowers and gardens.</p>
                <h4>Other demographics:</h4>
                    <p>As mentioned above I want to focus on families for now. I know that stay at home parents who do home school tend to look for differnt learning oportunities for their children. From families I have observed, they value expreiences along side education. I also focused on an older age group because by then people tend to be further in their career and therefore more likely to buy season passes or eating out. And if they don't have a family they are more inclided to spend a bit more on dates or looking for a place to hold an event. Such as weddings or work events. It also will appeal to individuals who are more inclined to outdoor activities and/or nature.</p>

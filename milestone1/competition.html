        <h2>The pros, cons, and take aways from competitors</h2>
                <h4>Pros:</h4>
                    <p>WHen exoloring other sites of similar buisnesses I noticed a lot of beneficial components. On all of the websites they had several items that I liked. They made ticketing easily accessible. I also loved their color palettes. All but one company I looked at had a simple white and light green palette. That way any photo they used of their property/gardens blended in extremely well. It made them pop and was extremely pleasing. Not everyone did these next ones, but I loved the ones that did. Some provided a map, some had a diner or cafe, and they had their logo nice and big with their name in the corner at all times. One had a detailed page dedicated to each exhibit in their gardens. Another one had a photo album of their exhibits that was enough to inspire a visit, but not enough to feel like you no longer need to visit the park. Some had carosels, I'm in love with that. Some also have a page deicated to booking events and details regarding it. And lastly, they had details on what events were coming up and important dates to know. This could help inspire local people to keep coming back and to get a membership.</p>
                <h4>Cons:</h4>
                    <p>Some of their photos are lacking in the property aspect. They don't show enough of their gardens and exibits to invoke people to come. Most of them didn't have good layouts. They banked on having a large photo and a lot of words. It made then look out of data and makes it harder to keep the viewer interested. I didn't like having the menu across the top of the screen. I prefered a drop down menu. It looks cleaner and doesn't take away from the page you are actually on. I also didn't like it when companies used stock photos. I have to use them because I am creating a website for my dream job. But if you have an actual busines, then you need to show it. And make sure the photos you take are clean and high quality. Several of the websites had blurry photos. And while most websites had the clean white and light green palette, one of them didn't have a color palette and another one had a dark pink palette. This looked bad when paired up with some of the very colorful pages. Espcially the pages dedicated to a specific color. For example, they had an all yellow seasonal page. The dark pink was a clash. That is the oposite of what you actually want.</p>
                <h4>Take aways:</h4>
                    <p>Have a clean and simple color palette. Have crisp photos, and a lot of photos. When creating my layout I'm going to make sure I pair each paragh with a photo on my home page. And I will have minimal wording in my side pages with multiple photos that go with it. I want a drop down menu. My name and logo in the top at all times except for my home page. I  want my logo right in the middle of my main photo. I want pages dedicated to exibits, special events, and annual events. I also want to provide a map for viewers. I very much want a carosel and a little family train too. And having either an outdoor cafe or green house resturant is a huge reason for people to come and keep coming. I also would like to hold events in parts of my gardens. I also want to have a tickets and membership page. I want locals to be frequent visitors. I also want a park in there as well. Nothing crazy but small enough to be a good break spot for families.</p>
